Thank you for installing and using GraphViz.NET

A new element with key "graphVizLocation" has been added the appSettings of your web.config or app.config.

Use this to specify the location of your graphviz installation.

For example, if you have the graphviz exe files (dot.exe, fdp.exe etc.) in a folder in C:\GraphViz 
then your web.config or app.config should have the following:

<appSettings>
    <add key="graphVizLocation" value="C:\GraphViz" />
</appSettings>
